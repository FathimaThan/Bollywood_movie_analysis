# Bollywood Movie Analysis

## About the Datasets

This project explores three datasets related to the Bollywood film industry:

1. **[Bollywood Actor Ranking Dataset](https://github.com/FathimaThan/Bollywood_movie_analysis/blob/main/BollywoodActorRanking.csv)**: This dataset contains information about Bollywood actors, including their rankings based on various metrics such as movie count, normalized movie rank, normalized Google rank, and normalized rating.

2. **[Bollywood Director Ranking Dataset](https://github.com/FathimaThan/Bollywood_movie_analysis/blob/main/BollywoodDirectorRanking.csv)**: This dataset provides rankings of Bollywood directors, including metrics such as movie count, normalized movie rank, normalized Google rank, and normalized rating.

3. **[Movie Ranking Dataset](https://github.com/FathimaThan/Bollywood_movie_analysis/blob/main/BollywoodMovieDetail.csv)**: This dataset comprises details about Bollywood movies released between 2001 to 2014. It includes information such as movie title, release year, release date, genre, writers, actors, directors, sequel status, hit/flop rating, and lead actors.

The datasets were obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning competitions, datasets, and notebooks.

## About the Project

This project aims to analyze the Bollywood movie industry using the provided datasets. It involves exploring factors that contribute to the success of movies, including the influence of actors, directors, genres, and other relevant factors. Analysis is performed using Python (Pandas, numpy) and SQL to extract insights and patterns from the data.

## Analysis

- Analyzed the distribution of actor and director rankings based on various metrics.
- Investigated the impact of factors such as release date, genre, and production house on movie success.
- Utilized SQL queries to extract insights and patterns from the dataset.

## Repository Structure

- `BollywoodActorRanking.csv`: Dataset containing rankings of Bollywood actors.
- `BollywoodDirectorRanking.csv`: Dataset containing rankings of Bollywood directors.
- `BollywoodMovieDetail.csv`: Dataset containing details of Bollywood movies.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the project.
- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing steps.
- `project.sql`: SQL file containing queries used for data analysis.

## Steps Followed

1. **Data Preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - Preprocessed the dataset in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, which involved cleaning the data and handling null values.

2. **Cleaning Null Values**:
   - Identified and cleaned null values from the dataset to ensure data integrity.

3. **Date Column Corrections in Excel**:
   - Made corrections to the date column in Microsoft Excel to ensure proper formatting for SQL queries, as SQL can have issues reading certain date formats. 

4. **Dataset Saving**:
   - Saved the preprocessed dataset for further analysis.

5. **Querying the Datasets**:
   - Utilized the preprocessed datasets to write SQL queries for analysis and extracting insights.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL (MySql)
- Jupyter Notebook
